# This is a micropython convertion for the code provided by DFRobot.com for the arduino platform.

# For the temperature compensation is used the DFRobot_PH.py library from DFRobot.com
# Original: https://github.com/DFRobot/DFRobot_PH/blob/master/RaspberryPi/Python/DFRobot_PH.py

# For connection to an ESP32 board we do not need a voltage divider,
# the transmitter Board has an MAX OUTPUT VOLTAGE of 2.3V

# ESP32 --> 12 bit ADC --> 4095 samples at 3.3V
# ADC Pin; 0, 2, 4, 12, 13, 14, 15, 25, 26, 27, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 39

# TDS --> ESP32
# --------------------
# VCC --> 5.5V or 3.3V
# A   --> Analog Pin
# GND --> GND
